# Dispatcher

  A web application designed and completed as a capstone project for LaunchCode's LC101.
Dispatcher's purpose is to provide a simplistic interface for managing work orders as a mobile based business.

### Key features include:
  * Creating and managing employees, customers, and work orders.
  * Assigning work orders to employees.
  * Starting and completing work orders.
  * Searching for employees, customers, and work orders.
  * Google maps integration for job locations.
  
### Possible features to add:
  * Tracking time to completion for work orders.
  * Tracking of various statistics such as average job completion time, average work orders per month for each customer, etc.
  * Ordering of pending jobs based on distance from current location.
  
### Improvements needed:
  * Ability to add multiple locations per customer, or to seperate location data from customer data.
  * Assigning multiple employers to the same work order.
  * Better layout design, especially for smaller devices.
  
### Difficult but wanted features:
  * Display of single map with all pending jobs for an employee to enable easy routing(Likely requires paid features of google maps api)
  * Email/Text notifications for newly assigned work orders as well as when an assigned work orders start time is approaching(~1 hour).
  * Invoice creation/tracking. (Opens door for more statistics tracking as well)
